# RustRAGVectorDB: A Rust-Based Secure Vector Database for Retrieval-Augmented Generation

## 1. Motivation

Modern AI applications increasingly rely on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to extend large language models (LLMs) with up-to-date, external information. These systems depend on databases that can store and retrieve vector embeddings, numerical representations of text that capture meaning,  efficiently and securely.  

While many mature vector databases exist, such as FAISS, Pinecone, and Weaviate, they are primarily written in Python, Go, or C++, and often depend on managed services or cloud infrastructure. These constraints limit user control, data privacy, and customizability.  

Rust presents an opportunity to address these issues. It combines performance, memory safety, and concurrency in a way that makes it ideal for developing high-performance backend systems. However, there is currently no lightweight, Rust-native vector database tailored to RAG workflows, one that allows developers to fully control how data is ingested, chunked, embedded, indexed, and queried in a secure and local environment.  

This project aims to fill that gap by developing a secure, high-performance vector database written entirely in Rust, designed for adaptable data ingestion and embedding workflows. The project is both technically engaging and practically relevant: it leverages Rust’s systems-level strengths to build an open, modular infrastructure for RAG applications, where users maintain full control over their data and retrieval process.

This idea originated from my time working at Amazon, where I helped build a RAG system using Amazon Kendra as the retrieval layer. While Kendra is powerful and well-integrated within AWS, I experienced firsthand how slow ingestion and indexing times can bottleneck experimentation and deployment. Kendra also abstracts away much of the underlying data handling, offering limited control over how documents are chunked, embedded, and indexed. These constraints inspired me to develop a Rust-based alternative that preserves the performance and reliability expected in production systems, while providing developers with full transparency and configurability across every stage of the retrieval process.

## 2. Objective and Key Features

### Objective

The objective of this project is to build a Rust-based secure vector database that supports end-to-end data processing for RAG. The system will allow users to ingest data from files or folders, automatically process it into meaningful text chunks, generate embeddings, and index them for fast and accurate retrieval, all through a secure HTTPS interface.

The project’s overarching goal is to provide a flexible, privacy-conscious alternative to existing RAG databases, emphasizing adaptability and transparency in how data is handled and retrieved.

Existing Rust-based solutions such as Qdrant, Tantivy, Meilisearch, and Quickwit each provide parts of a modern search or vector infrastructure, from lexical retrieval to vector indexing, but none deliver a complete, RAG-oriented pipeline that unifies ingestion, chunking, embedding, indexing, and secure delivery in one cohesive, Rust-native system. These tools typically rely on pre-embedded data or external orchestration layers, which limits transparency and user control. RustRAGVectorDB fills this gap by integrating the entire retrieval process within a single, modular Rust framework. It enables users to experiment with and customize how their data is prepared, embedded, and served, while maintaining the performance, safety, and concurrency guarantees that distinguish Rust from other ecosystems.

### Key Features

#### **1. Flexible Data Ingestion**
- Accepts both individual JSON files and folders of JSON documents.  
- Standard schema: `{ "doc_id": "string", "source_uri": "string", "text": "string" }`.  
- Performs schema validation and normalization during ingestion.

#### **2. Adaptive Chunking**
- Allows users to configure chunk length, overlap, and segmentation strategy.  
- Supports both fixed-size and adaptive (semantic) chunking options.  
- Uses Rust’s concurrency model for efficient parallel processing of large text datasets.

#### **3. Embedding Generation**
- Converts text chunks into vector embeddings using configurable backends (local models or APIs).  
- Supports customizable embedding parameters such as batch size, dimensionality, and normalization.  
- Serializes embeddings efficiently for persistence and fast lookup.

#### **4. Indexing and Retrieval**
- Builds and manages vector indexes for similarity-based retrieval.  
- Supports modular retrieval methods, allowing different strategies to be plugged in or combined later.  
- Optimized for low latency and scalability, with options for persistent or in-memory indexing.

#### **5. Secure HTTPS Delivery**
- Exposes a RESTful API using Rust’s web frameworks (e.g., `axum` or `warp`).  
- Provides endpoints for ingestion, querying, and inspecting index statistics.  
- Ensures secure data transfer with HTTPS and authentication via tokens (JWT).  

#### **6. Visualization Interface**
- Front end built with a Rust + WebAssembly framework (e.g., `Yew` or `Leptos`).  
- Displays embedding relationships and retrieval results interactively.  
- Helps users monitor ingestion, query performance, and system statistics.

## 3. Tentative Plan

The project will be completed individually and divided into a series of manageable phases. Each phase builds upon the last, ensuring continuous progress and testing throughout the development cycle.

### **Phase 1: Project Setup and Data Ingestion**
**Goal:** Create the foundational structure of the project and implement JSON ingestion.  

**Tasks:**  
- Initialize a Rust project with separate modules for ingestion and chunking.  
- Implement logic for loading and validating JSON input from files or folders.  
- Add schema checks and error handling for malformed documents.  

**Deliverables:**  
- Working ingestion module and sample dataset tests.

### **Phase 2: Chunking and Embedding**
**Goal:** Enable data transformation from text to embeddings.  

**Tasks:**  
- Implement configurable chunking based on size and overlap.  
- Add embedding pipeline using either local or API-based models.  
- Store embeddings efficiently for later retrieval.  

**Deliverables:**  
- End-to-end pipeline: raw text → chunks → embeddings.

### **Phase 3: Indexing and Retrieval**
**Goal:** Implement vector storage and retrieval functionality.  

**Tasks:**  
- Develop efficient indexing methods for similarity search.  
- Add basic retrieval and ranking operations.

### **Feasibility**
- The project leverages mature Rust crates (`serde`, `tokio`, `axum`, `ndarray`, etc.), minimizing overhead.  
- Development focuses on modular, incremental progress to ensure a demonstrable, working prototype.  
- The visualization and advanced retrieval features will be optional extensions if time permits.
